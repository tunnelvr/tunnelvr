This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.

We use Your Personal data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, You agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

# Your personal data and activities

This cave drawing app does not collect or hold information about your username, account, 
location, contact details or any other any data about online activity levels.

If, from within the app, you join the multiplayer server godot.doesliverpool.xyz, then your 
VR movements and drawings can be seen by other players who are online at the time.  
Your avatar is assigned a randomly chosen name which you can edit at any time, and nothing is recorded.  
The microphone and voice communication are disabled.  
(If you wish to communicate verbally you need to set up your own channel such as the Oculus 
Party mode or Whatsapp on a nearby phone.)

Loading and saving of cave drawing data is done directly to the Github website.  A public read-only 
repository is available by default at https://github.com/goatchurchprime/tunnelvr_cave_data but should you 
wish to save any of your own drawings it is up to you to make your own account with Github and install 
your own API key into the app's local memory to grant you with write access.
